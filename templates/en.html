      <li>Metadata associated with your communications (e.g., timestamps, participants).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please be aware that **Matrix is a federated network**. This means:</p>

      <li>While we strive to secure your data on our server, we cannot control the data storage, security, or privacy practices of other federated servers.</li>
    </ul>

It is your responsibility to keep your contact information updated.</p>

    <h2>4. Server Administrator Rights and Content Moderation üõ°Ô∏è</h2>

Our detailed privacy practices, including information on data collection, use, sharing, and your rights regarding your data, are outlined in our separate **Privacy Policy for Sentry Chat**.

    <h2>6. Changes to These Terms üìú</h2>
